# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share this space with you where I'll be writing about machine learning, software engineering, and various projects I'm working on.

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Technical tutorials** and insights from my work in ML engineering
- **Project deep-dives** including challenges and solutions
- **Industry thoughts** on AI/ML trends and developments
- **Personal experiences** from consulting and building products

## Why I Started This Blog

As someone who has worked across healthcare, e-commerce, and SaaS industries, I've encountered many interesting problems and solutions. This blog is my way of documenting and sharing these experiences with the broader community.

## Recent Work

I'm currently working on [AdTestPro](https://github.com/AnanyaP-WDW/AdTestPro) and my [Hacker News recommender](https://hn.ananyapathak.xyz/). Both projects involve interesting ML challenges that I'm excited to write about.
